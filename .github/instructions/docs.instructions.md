## Markdown Content Standards

Follow these standards for all markdown documentation in the design folder:

### Headings
- Use `##` for H2 and `###` for H3 to structure content hierarchically.
- Do not use H1; it is auto-generated from the title.
- Avoid H4 and deeper unless absolutely necessary.

### Lists
- Use `-` for bullet points and `1.` for numbered lists.
- Indent nested lists with two spaces.
- Ensure proper indentation and spacing.

### Code Blocks
- Use triple backticks (```) for fenced code blocks.
- Specify the language after the opening backticks for syntax highlighting (e.g., `csharp`, `js`).

### Links
- Use `[link text](URL)` for links.
- Ensure link text is descriptive and URLs are valid and accessible.

### Images
- Use `![alt text](image URL)` for images.
- Include brief, descriptive alt text for accessibility.

### Tables
- Use `|` to create tables.
- Include headers and ensure columns are properly aligned.

### Whitespace & Line Length
- Limit line length to 80 characters for readability.
- Use blank lines to separate sections and improve readability.
- Avoid excessive whitespace.

## Validation Requirements

- Ensure all content follows the standards above.
- No front matter unless required by the documentation system.
- Use markdownlint or similar tools to validate formatting and structure.

**Note:** These standards ensure clarity, accessibility, and maintainability for all design documentation.
